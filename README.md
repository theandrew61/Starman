# Starman (version 2.0)

## Description
This is my first mod! This mod grants you invincibility like in Mario games.

Particles spawn. You run faster. You take no damage. You are fireproof. A meter shows in the bottom right showing how much star power is left. You do not ragdoll. Any NPC that comes near you instantly dies. Your vehicle (if in one) is fireproof. It takes no damage. Any other vehicle that you hit instantly explodes.

**Starman lasts 20 seconds. You will not gain any stars for a cop dying as a result of you being invincible.**

Starman's activation key can be configured. ***By default, the NumPad 9 key activates starman.*** To do that, go to the *scripts* folder and edit the *Starman.ini* file and change "105" to any number based on a key. A full [list can be found here](http://cherrytree.at/misc/vk.htm).
